Steam Chinese Broccoli using whatever method you want - I microwave in a steamer on high for 4 minutes. The stem should be just cooked - not super soft and floppy. Stack the Chinese broccoli together and cut into 4/10cm lengths, then stack neatly on top of each other. Combine water and corn flour in small saucepan, mix to dissolve. Then add remaining ingredients, turn stove onto medium and bring to boil. Boil for 30 seconds to allow to thicken, then remove from stove. Drizzle over Chinese broccoli and serve. Best served warm."
